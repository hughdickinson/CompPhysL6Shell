# INSTALL SOME NEW UTILITIES:
# ===========================
# To install utilities ON UBUNTU LINUX, one can use the apt-get
# command. This command is NOT GENERALLY available on other
# operating systems. The required syntax to install a new utility
# looks like:
#
# $ sudo apt-get install UTILITY-IDENTIFIER
#
# NOTE: "sudo" is a special shell command with a name that is
# short for SuperUserDO. It enables subsequent shell commands to
# update parts of the Linux filesystem that would normally be
# write-protected. If you prepend a shell command with "sudo" you
# may be prompted for a password. Just enter the same password you
# use to log into Linux when starting the VirtualBox.

# 1) SOURCE-HIGHLIGHT:
# ====================
# The source-highlight utility can be used to produce "pretty"
# terminal output for C++ and Python source code, as well as
# shell commands and scripts. To install it enter:

sudo apt-get install source-highlight

# The source-highlight utility supports numerous flags. Invoke
# "man source-highlight" for more information. Among the most
# important are:
# -i inputFile		: specifies that "inputFile" should be highlighted.
# -f outputFormat	: specifies the format that should be used to
#                   	render the highlighted output. In general, use:
#                   	-f "esc".
# -o outputFile        	: specifies the "file" to which the highlighted output
#    		       	should be written. To write to the terminal, use:
#			-o "STDOUT" 
# To test source-highlight, try the following command which highlights
# the C++ demonstration material from Lecture 5 and pipes the result to
# the "more" pager utility.

source-highlight -f esc -i -o STDOUT | more

# 2) THE GNU SCIENTIFIC LIBRARY:
# ==============================
# The GNU Scientific Library (or GSL) is a software library for numerical
# computations in applied mathematics and science. The GSL is written in C.
# Wrappers are available for other programming languages (including Python).

# This command will install the GSL SHARED LIBRARY (named libgsl.so) in the
# /usr/lib directory.
sudo apt-get install libgsl0ldbl

# This command will install the GSL HEADER FILES in the /usr/include directory.
sudo apt-get install libgsl0-dev


# CLONING YOUR GITHUB HOMEWORK REPOSITORY:
# ========================================
# If you emailed me with your GitHub username, then I have created a new
# repository on GitHub that you can not only read using git clone, but also
# update using git push. ONLY YOU AND I have write access to your repository.
# You will use this repository to submit part of this week's homework and
# similar repositories will be set up for you to submit your midterm and
# final projects.
#
# The URL for your PERSONAL HOMEWORK REPOSITORY looks like:
# https://github.com/ISUComputationalPhysics/<FirstName><Surname>Homework.git
#
# Where you should replace <FirstName> and <Surname> with appropriate values.
#
# 0) IF you had problems with the git pull/push example in Lecture 5 you MAY
#    need to invoke the following command.

git config --global push.default simple

# 1) Update the local git config to reflect your REAL name and EMAIL.

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@iastate.edu"

# 2) Begin working with your new repository by creating a clone in VirtualBox in
# the /home/computationalphysics/Documents/homework directory.

git clone https://github.com/ISUComputationalPhysics/<FirstName><Surname>Homework.git /home/computationalphysics/Documents/homework

# You will be prompted to enter your GitHub username and password.
# Enter both to clone the repository.

# 3) Navigate to the freshly cloned working directory.

cd /home/computationalphysics/Documents/homework

# 4) Create a new directory for this week's homework and add a file
# to that directory.

mkdir lecture6
echo "Lecture 6 Homework Notes:" > lecture6/notes

# 5) Stage and commit the new directory

git status
git add lecture6
git commit -m"Added new directory for Lecture 6 homework"

# 6) Update the remote repository to reflect your local changes.

git push
